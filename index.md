While running Kissu.moe, Verniy was a student of computer science and a member of 4chan's /qa/ board. After graduating his main focus was building a unique identity for the site and creating a model for financial stability. He has written scripts for IRCs and imageboards, dabbled in music and worked on independent games. His education is a batchelors degree in computer science and cegep(pre-university) degree in music.<br/>

His duties are to maintain the software, expand the software, security tools, handle any legal/external issues, help staff deal with internal issues, bring in new staff members, expand on infastructure.

### History

#### Birth-2002 : 
Verniy moved a lot as a kid from Toronto ending up in Montreal. Moving around a lot, the computer was his best friend. At that time, and the places he was in, he did not have reliable internet connection for most of his youth and would use it to pass away the early years of his life.
#### 2003-2008 : 
His younger years were rough. However, he now had a stable internet connection which got him interested in flash games, online games and anime. This was the point where the Internet began being somewhere he could socialize. In highschool he heard of imageboards and lurked a bit, though they were not as interesting as socializing through games and their associated forums.

#### 2009-2015 : 
Eventually he would find casual interest in 4chan's /a/ and /b/ boards as well as ocasionally view some of the smaller boards on the site. His interest in 4chan was on and off. A side thing while he studied sciences and a small part of his life while devoted to music at university.

#### 2015 : 
A future in music requires strong networking, something he never much cared for so. He dropped out of it in his second year and enrolled in a batchelor's degree for computer science. After ditching his former life and following along with the flow of media at the time, his interest in imageboards was political in nature where being outraged was the most entertaining thing and convinient escapism.
#### 2015-2018 : 
Eventually getting tired of the poltical atmosphere he wound up posting on /qa/. This board was both a means to entertain himself while classes were boring, socialize in a more simple atmosphere, and talk shit about the state of 4chan. Numerous hyjnx ensued which got himself and a friend(cool-guy) known(and subsequently banned) by 4chan's mods. They amoung other anonymous users helped take part in building a community in a remote part of the internet. when it became clear that the staff truely did not want them around they made kissu.moe as a place where they did not have to deal with 4chan and could be thier own bosses, seperate from the political types that were coming to dominate the definition of imageboard.
#### 2018-Present : 
Graduating in 2019, Canada's cheap cost of eduction left Verniy with a large sum of funds after graduating. This would become his main source of funding while working on kissu, allowing him to focus on his websites in peace. They continue to build kissu.moe with help from others, dealing with the troubles of running a social platform on the web. Eventually Verniy acquired 4taba.net as the previous owner was no longer interested in running social platforms and run it. This provided an excuse to expand Kissu.moe's servers and keep a unique website up on the internet. Still with much funds left over he is now looking at how to make a living for himself while continuing to support Kissu's growth.

### Need Help?

If you have an imageboard and are in need of a developer I might be able to help for a cost. I'm always open to develop new scripts and add features to your software. I'm a university trained computer scientist with 3 years of development experience on imageboards in PHP, NodeJS, TypeScript and Golang. Some other work in Python3, Unity Game Engine(C#), Laravel. I am not at the same level as others, but have done a bit with Ruby, C++(OpenGL) and Guile-Scheme(Artanis). I could write something basic in these languages

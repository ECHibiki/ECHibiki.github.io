## Portfolio
I'm a developer with most of my experience in TypeScript. I have spent a lot of time modifying and building open-source PHP projects. Lately I have built Golang API servers and made use of NodeJS for prerendering a React UI. In the past I've built programs around Google, Twitter and Github APIs and played around with user-scripts. My university education is in game programming, but I've always had more fun spending my time on websites. These are some of my interesting projects.

### Need Help?

If you are in need of a developer I might be able to help for a cost. I'm always open to develop new scripts and add features to your software. I'm a university trained computer scientist with 3 years of development experience on imageboards in PHP, NodeJS, TypeScript and Golang. Some other work in Python3, Unity Game Engine(C#), Laravel. I have done a bit with Ruby, C++(OpenGL) and Guile-Scheme(Artanis) and could write something basic in these languages. Down payment will to my PayPal upon accepting a job.

### Extras
Some extra info about me that may or may not be interesting.

#### History
Timeline from birth to present
##### Birth-2002 :
Verniy moved a lot as a kid from Toronto ending up in Montreal. Moving around a lot, the computer was his best friend. He did not have reliable internet connection for most of his youth, but would use it to pass away the early years of his life.
##### 2003-2008 :
Finally having a stable internet connection he began consuming internet culture in the form of flash games, online games and anime. This was the point where the Internet began being somewhere he could socialize. In highschool he heard of imageboards and lurked a bit, though they were not as interesting as socializing through games and their associated forums.

##### 2009-2015 :
Eventually he would find casual interest in 4chan's /a/ and /b/ boards as well as occasionally view some of the smaller boards on the site. His interest in 4chan was on and off. A side thing to his studies.

##### 2015 :
In university he dropped out of his studies in music and enrolled in a bachelor's degree for computer science. After ditching his former life he followed the trends of the time finding interest in 4chan, getting angry at right-wing posters. His interest in imageboards in that year was political in nature where being outraged was the most entertaining thing and convinient escapism.

##### 2015-2018 :
Tired of the political atmosphere he wound up posting on /qa/. This board was both a means to entertain himself while classes were boring, socialize in a more simple atmosphere, and talk smack about the state of 4chan. It's here that Verniy would hone his programming skills creating userscripts and applications to improve 4chan's experience. ```bans.verniy.ca``` was created to publish a list of 4chan's user bans. Userscripts were created to get a better user experience out of the interface and a captcha solver was made to make helpful bots easier to create.
Numerous hyjnx ensued which got himself and a friend(cool-guy) known by 4chan's mod team. They among other anonymous users helped take part in building a community in a remote part of the internet. when it became clear that the staff truly did not want them around they made kissu.moe as a place where they did not have to deal with 4chan and could be their own bosses, separate from the political types that were coming to dominate the definition of an imageboard.

##### 2018-Present :
Graduating in 2019, Canada's cheap cost of education left Verniy with a large sum of funds after graduating. This would become his main source of funding while working on Kissu.moe, allowing him to focus on his websites in peace. They continue to build Kissu.moe with help from others, dealing with the troubles of running a social platform on the web. Eventually Verniy acquired 4taba.net as the previous owner was no longer interested in running a social platform. This provided an excuse to expand Kissu.moe's servers and keep a unique website up on the internet. Kissu continues to grow in size and Verniy searches for a means to make a living on the internet, not compromising on his commitment to his websites.

## Who Am I

Verniy(ECHibiki) is the developer, admin and creator of Kissu.moe, current admin of 4taba.net. Along with Cool-Guy they have run Kissu.moe since December 2018. He holds a batchelors degree in computer science and cegep(pre-university) degree in music.

### History

Birth-2002 : Moved a lot as a kid from Toronto ending up in Montreal. As a kid who couldn't make friends easily, the computer ended up being my best friend. At that time, and the places I was in, I did not have reliable internet for some of the tougher years of my life.
2003-2008: Elementary school I was in was rough for me. Dialup was no longer a thing in my life though so I began getting into flash games, anime and online games. This was the point where the Internet began being somewhere I could socialize. In highschool I heard of imageboards, though they were not as interesting as socializing in games and forums.
2009-2015: Eventually I would find casual interest in 4chan's /a/ and /b/ boards as well as ocasionally view some of the smaller boards on the site. My interest in 4chan was on an off. A side thing while I studied sciences in cegep and a small part of my life while in music at university. I recall a roommate complaining to the dorms that I was viewing 4chan on a laptop on my first week there which was funny, we didn't hit it off.
2015: A future in music requires strong networking, something I never much cared for so I dropped out of it in my second year and enrolled in a batchelor's degree for computer science. Thankfully Canada's education is cheap and I never went into debt. My former friend was a massively political autist who would constantly talk about the benefits of capitalism and how government is evil. After ditching him and following along with the flow of media at the time, my interest in imageboards was political in nature where being outraged was the most entertaining thing. I liked to use it as a way to talk shit about a political philosophy that I don't believe in.  
2015-2018: Eventually I mellowed out after the US elections were over and wound up on /qa/. I posted on the board as both a means to entertain myself while classes were boring and talk shit about the state of 4chan. Numerous hyjnx ensued which got myself and a friend(cool-guy) in trouble and known by 4chan's mods. We helped take part in building a community in a remote part of the internet and when it became clear that the staff truely did not want us around we made kissu.moe as a place where we did not have to deal with 4chan and could be our own bosses, seperate from the political types that were coming to dominate the definition of imageboard.
2018-Present: We continue to build kissu.moe with help from others, dealing with the troubles of running an social platform on the web. Eventually I acquired 4taba.net as the previous owner was no longer interested in running social platforms and run it for an extra server for kissu and maintain a website that is unique amoung others. 

### Current Work

Currently I develop and exepand kissu.moe. My duties are to maintain the software, expand the software, security tools, handle any legal/external issues, help staff deal with internal issues, bring in new staff members, expand on infastructure. I maintain a github repository with some open source work such as a program to rotate user submitted banners and the public source code of kissu's Vichan variant. 

### Need Help?

If you have an imageboard and are in need of a developer I might be able to help for a cost. I'm always open to develop new scripts and add features to your software. I'm a university trained computer scientist with 3 years of development experience on imageboards in PHP, NodeJS, TypeScript and Golang. Some other work in Python3, Unity Game Engine(C#), Laravel. I am not at the same level as others, but have done a bit with Ruby, C++(OpenGL) and Guile-Scheme(Artanis). I could write something basic in these languages
